# CTF-Write-Ups

I've been doing CTF challenges for a little bit now.

I've decided to start doing write ups with them and document my process for myself in the future, and anyone else who happens to wander into here.

Installed Packages (on the VM I use a lot, and not including a lot of stuff that came pre-installed or I only use once in a while):

1. `sudo apt update`: Upgrade apt
2. `sudo apt upgrade`: Update all installed packages
3. `sudo apt install binutils`: Some nice utilities
4. `sudo apt install nmap`: Nmap and Ncat
5. `sudo apt install sleuthkit`: Sleuthkit
6. `sudo apt install wireshark`: Wireshark
7. `sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl`: Exiftool
8. `sudo apt install net-tools`: Net Tools
9. `sudo apt-get install binwalk`: Binwalk
10. `sudo dpkg --add-architecture i386`: Adding support for i386 (run update after)
11. `sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib`: Library for 32 bit ELF support
12. `sudo apt install python3-pip`: pip for install python packages (like pwntools)

Shout out to GCC, GDB, LLDB, Python, Apt, Node.js, PIP, and many more I can't remember right now.
