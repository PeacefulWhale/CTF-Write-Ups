# CTF-Write-Ups

I've been doing CTF challenges for a little bit now.

I've decided to start doing write ups with them and document my process for myself in the future, and anyone else who happens to wander into here.

Installed Packages (on the VM I use a lot):

1. `sudo apt update`: Upgrade apt
2. `sudo apt install openvpn unzip`: openVPN
3. `sudo apt install nmap`: Nmap and Ncat
4. `sudo apt install sleuthkit`: Sleuthkit
5. `sudo apt install wireshark`: Wireshark
6. `sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl`: Exiftool
7. `sudo apt install net-tools`: Net Tools
