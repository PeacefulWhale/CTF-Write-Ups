# CTF-Write-Ups

I've been doing CTF challenges for a little bit now.

I've decided to start doing write ups with them and document my process for myself in the future, and anyone else who happens to wander into here.

Installed Packages (on the VM I use a lot, and not including a lot of stuff that came pre-installed or I only use once in a while):

1. `sudo apt update`: Upgrade apt
2. `sudo apt upgrade`: Update all installed packages
3. `sudo apt install binutils`: Some nice utilities
4. `sudo apt install nmap`: Nmap and Ncat
5. `sudo apt install sleuthkit`: Sleuthkit
6. `sudo apt install wireshark`: Wireshark
7. `sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl`: Exiftool
8. `sudo apt install net-tools`: Net Tools
9. `sudo apt-get install binwalk`: Binwalk

Shout out to GCC, GDB, LLDB, Python, Apt, Node.js, PIP, and many more I can't remember right now.
